"""

This code tries to figure out where a patch needs to be applied for a build to succeed. 
To achieve this, it heavily uses git and bisections and with that the terms 'good' and 'bad'.
However, 'good' does mean something different in different circumstances does not always indicate
a successful build.

The convention used for good and bad is taken from the normal use-case of `git bisect`:
    Something broke along the way and is now bad. Additionally, we know a commit, which worked,
    which is good.
So the bad commit is the newest w.r.t. the git history i.e. good is ancestor of bad.
And this is how 'good' and 'bad' are (should be) used in this file.

Other concepts are:
    introducer: The first commit, that makes a test fail.
    fixer: The first commit, that does not make a test fail, i.e. fixed it.
